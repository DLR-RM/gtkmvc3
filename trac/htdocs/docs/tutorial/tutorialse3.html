<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >The implementation of this example is split into three distinct parts. First, the <span 
class="cmti-10">GUI</span>
is constructed from a <span 
class="cmsl-10">Glade </span>file. Second, the <span 
class="cmti-10">GUI </span>is constructed <span 
class="cmti-10">by hand</span>, by creating
and connecting manually all widgets. Third, adapters are applied to make the code
much easier.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   Hand-made view is mainly presented to make this tutorial more complete, but the
readers should keep in mind that they are going to adopt the former most of the
times, or even more often a mixture of them, where many parts come from one or
more glade files, and some others are built manually.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   The use of glade files is also the reason why the <span 
class="cmti-10">pygtkmvc </span>framework
is split into three distinct parts. It is a matter of fact that in practice the
Model-View-Controller pattern will almost always collapse to a two-level
framework, where the View and the Controller are represented by a unique
monolithic entity (let&#8217;s call it <span 
class="cmti-10">V&amp;C</span>), and the Model is still separated by the
rest.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmti-10">pygtkmvc </span>framework provides three well-distinguishable levels, to allow the
pure-glade parts to go into the View side (in a direct and very natural way), and all
the remaining parts that would be put in the <span 
class="cmti-10">V&amp;C </span>part, to go either in the
Controller part, or in the View part, depending on how much close to the <span 
class="cmti-10">GUI </span>stuff
are.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   For example, all the widgets signal handlers must go in the Controller side,
whereas the code that sets some attributes of a specific widget might live either in
the Controller or in the View, depending on how much those attributes are bounded
to the application logic.
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   The more some code depends on the logic of the application, the farther it lives
from the View side. If some code depends only on the logic without any relation with
the <span 
class="cmti-10">GUI </span>stuff, it must live in the Model.
