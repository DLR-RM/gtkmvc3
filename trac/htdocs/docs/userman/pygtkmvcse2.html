<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >One major effort of Software Engineering has been to provide a way of optimally
separating the logical parts that constitute a software. This issue becomes a
question of outstanding importance in middle/large interactive software, where
an agent like an human user interacts with the software, likely through a
Graphic User Interface (<span 
class="cmti-10">GUI</span>). To separate the logic (data) of an application
from the representation of those data, several Architectural Patterns

have been studied; one is the Model&#8211;View&#8211;Controller (MVC) pattern that splits the
application into three separate parts, the <span 
class="cmti-10">Model</span>, the <span 
class="cmti-10">View </span>and the <span 
class="cmti-10">Controller</span>. The
level of mutual knowledge among these three entities is kept as minimal as possible,
and this results in:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Reduced wrong dependencies.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Software architecture forced to be better designed.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Minimized propagation of changes/modifications.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Higher costs of startup, but potential lower costs of maintenance.</li></ul>
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   To improve re-usability and robustness of software, the <span 
class="cmti-10">Observer </span>pattern is used
as well. This pattern identifies two entities: the <span 
class="cmti-10">Observable data </span>and the <span 
class="cmti-10">Observer</span>
over those data.<br 
class="newline" />The implementation of the <span 
class="cmti-10">Observer </span>pattern is intended to make the Observer take
some action when the Observable data change. This triggering mechanism
is a further abstraction layer that helps to design and implement robust
software.<br 
class="newline" />A possible use of the <span 
class="cmti-10">Observer </span>pattern is in combination with the <span 
class="cmti-10">MVC </span>pattern,
where the model communicates indirectly with the presentation side through the
observer pattern.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-10">gtkmvc </span>is a framework that implements both the MVC and Observer patterns
to be used to produce middle/large applications in Python and <span 
class="cmsl-10">PyGTK</span>.
<br 
class="newline" />The main goal is to provide a minimal (but not trivial) implementation, where

practical aspects are taken into serious consideration, and complexity is kept behind
the scene. This makes the users able to mainly focus their attention on the
application they need to produce, instead of dealing with the underlying
framework.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Pointless to say that goals are clear and likely easy to share by anyone. It is quite
a different thing to prove that those goals are reached by the proposed framework.
Frankly, this is up to the reader to decide.
