Released version 1.2.0

* New features:

  - Added adapters, new entities that largely simplify and reduce
    costs and development efforts. Adapters handles autonomous
    coordination between properties into models and widgets into
    views. Adapters are in a way similar to proxies featured by
    other frameworks like Kiwi.

  - Added script gtkmvc-progen that aids developers in generating
    gtkmvc-based projects from scratch. gtkmvc-progen can be run in
    both batch and GUI modalities. For example:
    $> gtkmvc-progen name=myproj author="Wil Shakespeare" gui=no

    ... generates project "myproj" in batch mode. See the user
    manual for a full list of available options.
    
* Other changes
  
  - Spurious value changes in observable properties are no longer
    notified by default. A new optional parameter of class Observer
    allows for a backward-compatible semantics.

  - Widgets search into Views has been optimized.

  - A few bug fixes and optimizations. 

    o Undefined handlers fr custom widgets are correctly
      handled. Thanks to Allan Douglas <zalguod at
      users.sourceforge.net> for providing a working patch.

	  o Fixed a subtle bug in the observer pattern implementation.

    o Searching widgets in View is now much faster.
