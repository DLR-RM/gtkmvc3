* New

  - adapt FileChooserButton
  - adapt ComboBox
  - API to extend default adapter list
  - more widget types now correctly cast when adapted to
    unicode/int/float properties.
  - enable RoUserClassAdapter to update the widget.
    It used to only do it when connecting, not on property changes.
    This makes the built-in support for gtk.Calendar work in both
    directions.
  - Controller's method adapt() allows auto-adaption even if the view
    does not have corresponding widgets for *all* properties in the
    model.

* Changed

  - support GtkBuilder in addition to libglade, which is no longer
    required.
    This changed the signature of the View constructor. The two
    formats are not equivalent, as GTK cannot build only parts of a
    file.

  - allow creation of adapters that act on spurious notifications.

  - if an adapter was passed prop_write on creation this is now called
    *instead of* casting the value from the widget to the type of the
    old property value. It used to be called after the cast.
    This was the intended behaviour all along, but breaks even some of
    our sample code.

  - use less eval(codestring)
    This changed how adapters create observer functions. If you have
    adapter subclasses you will have to adjust them.

* Fixed

  - assigning a tuple with length 3 to a property no longer raises

  - pass the correct model when emitting notifications for an
    inherited signal.
    This changes how all property wrappers track their owners, but
    your code should not be affected.

  - wrapped sequences lacked crucial special methods like len and
    iter.

  - inspecting wrappers no longer omits the class name

  - various changes to make SQLObjectModel actually usable

  - wrapping more than one sequence class could cause the wrong
    methods to be called on all but the last instance created. This
    did not affect programs that only use the built-in list type.

  - mutable instances that used to be assigned to properties would
    notify of their changes even after being replaced in the model.

Released version 1.99.0

This is a major release that breaks backward compatibility with the
1.2 family.

Also, this version is not stable yet, as there might be some changes
in the forthcoming releases toward version 2.0.0.

* New features
  Features 1 and 2 cause this version to be no backward compatible.
  
  1. View's constructor no longer takes a controller.

  2. Controller's constructor takes a view.
     This allows (together with 1.) to have multiple controllers
     controlling a shared view, making possible to decompose
     controllers (see the website for details)

  3. Support for SQLObject (support for SQLAlchemy delayed to 1.99.1)

  4. Support for custom observable properties in Models.
     Now it is possible to define observable properties whose values
     are stored outside the model, in a DB, a file, a network, etc.

  5. New syntax for defining observable properties.
     Now class attributes are used as in common ORMs.

  6. Explicit declaration of observing methods into observer through
     decorators.

  7. Views have attributes 'glade' and 'top' to simplify their
     construction.

  8. gtkmvc has now its own logging system that users can set when
     required. Previous naive prints have been removed. 

* Documentation
  1. New website

  2. New Quick Start Guide

  
* Refactoring, Bug fixes
  1. Improved performances

  2. Cleaned up View construction, that is now much more simple
  
  3. Fixed a row of minor bugs

Released version 1.2.2

This is a minor release that fixes two major bugs about adapters. 
A few new examples about adapters have been also added.

**********************************************************************

Released version 1.2.0

* New features:

  - Added adapters, new entities that largely simplify and reduce
    costs and development efforts. Adapters handles autonomous
    coordination between properties into models and widgets into
    views. Roughly speaking, an adapter keeps aligned some part of
    the model and a widget in a transparent and still customizable
    way.

  - Added script gtkmvc-progen that aids developers in generating
    gtkmvc-based projects from scratch. gtkmvc-progen can be run in
    both batch and GUI modalities. For example:
    $> gtkmvc-progen name=myproj author="Wil Shakespeare" gui=no

    ... generates project "myproj" in batch mode. See the user
    manual for a full list of available options.
    
* Other changes
  
  - Spurious value changes in observable properties are no longer
    notified by default. A new optional parameter of class Observer
    allows for a backward-compatible semantics.

  - Widgets search into Views has been optimized.

  - Bug fixes and optimizations. 

    o Undefined handlers for custom widgets are correctly
      managed. Thanks to Allan Douglas <zalguod TA users TOD
      sourceforge TOD net> for providing a working patch.

    o Fixed a subtle bug in the observer pattern implementation.

    o A few other minor fixes and optimizations.
