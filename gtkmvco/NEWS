Released version 1.99.0

This is a major release that breaks backward compatibility with the
1.2 family.

Also, this version is not stable yet, as there might be some changes
in the forthcoming releases toward version 2.0.0.

* New features
  Features 1 and 2 cause this version to be no backward compatible.
  
  1. View's constructor no longer takes a controller.

  2. Controller's constructor takes a view.
     This allows (together with 1.) to have multiple controllers
     controlling a shared view, making possible to decompose
     controllers (see the website for details)

  3. Support for SQLObject (support for SQLAlchemy delayed to 1.99.1)

  4. Support for custom observable properties in Models.
     Now it is possible to define observable properties whose values
     are stored outside the model, in a DB, a file, a network, etc.

  5. New syntax for defining observable properties.
     Now class attributes are used as in common ORMs.

  6. Explicit declaration of observing methods into observer through
     decorators.

  7. Views have attributes 'glade' and 'top' to simplify their
     construction.

  8. gtkmvc has now its own logging system that users can set when
     required. Previous naive prints have been removed. 

* Documentation
  1. New website

  2. New Quick Start Guide

  
* Refactoring, Bug fixes
  1. Improved performances

  2. Cleaned up View construction, that is now much more simple
  
  3. Fixed a row of minor bugs
