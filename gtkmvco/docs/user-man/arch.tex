\section{\label{ARCH} Architectural Overview}

Figure \ref{HLA_f} shows the high level software architecture for an
application based on \pygtk and the supplied \mvco Infrastructure.  It
shows the functional architecture as well.

In terms of functionalities, at the highest level is located the
\emph{Application Layer}, which is partially based on the \mvco
Infrastructure, and whose implementation depends on the application
semantics.

The \emph{\mvco Services Layer} supplies a quasi-generic platform
which implements the \mvc and the \obs. As the figure \ref{HLA_f}
depicts, the \mvco layer is partially based on \pygtk in order to
provide supports for the view and controller parts. Furthermore, model
part may access \pygtk when using the \mvc provided by \pygtk itself,
like for example \codename{TextBuffer} or \codename{TreeModel}
objects.

Lower layers supply several functionalities concerning the graphical
toolkit (GTK and \glade) and the Scripting Environment (namely
Python).
