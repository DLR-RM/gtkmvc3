\section{\label{MVCO} \mvco Infrastructure}


The \mvco framework provides a simplified and modified implementation
of the \mvc, and a very straightforward implementation of the \obs.

In the following a detailed description of each pattern is provided.
However, it is important to pinpoint here that the patterns have not
been implemented in a rigorous way. Instead, they have been adapted to
the particular way \pygtk based application are designed, making the
framework \emph{easy} and \emph{practical} to be used instead of being
fully compliant with the theoretical patterns.
