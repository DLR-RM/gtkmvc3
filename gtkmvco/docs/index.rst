Welcome to pygtkmvc
====================================

|gtkmvc| is a thin framework for supporting GUI programming with Python and PyGTK. Its major features are:

   #. A practical implementation of a Model-View-Controller pattern dialect.
   #. A transparent implementation of the Observer pattern.
   #. Guides the design and the structure to your application, still being behind the scene.
   #. |gtkmvc| is small: you can distribute it along with your application, with no bad effects on its dependencies list.
   #. A good set of documentation. 

For a quick example, see gtkmvc in 5 minutes.

|gtkmvc| is often compared to the great project Kiwi.
However, the two projects are different, as Kiwi focuses more on the presentation side while |gtkmvc| is more focused on the logic side of the application, and does not provide any extension to what the toolkit PyGTK provides.
