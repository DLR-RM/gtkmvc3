<big><b>A non-trivial example of gtkmvc</b></big>

The idea of this example is to design 
and develop a simple currency
converter. The idea is to split 
the logics and the presentation (<i>GUI</i>)
of the application. 
This allows users to use the application 
in both interactive and batch mode 
(i.e. from a command line).

The tutorial has been designed with 
an exaggerately complex structure,
as the goal is to show how <i>gtkmvc</i>
can be effectively used to design
and develop middle and large 
applications.

<b>Hope you'll enjoy working with 
<i>gtkmvc</i>!</b>
